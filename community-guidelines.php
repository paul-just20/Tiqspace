                        To help you understand what we do not allow on Eventbrite, we created this set of Community Guidelines. The list isn't exhaustive, and we may add to it or improve upon it, so it is important that you continue to check in on any modifications or updates frequently.

                If we determine that the content violates our Community Guidelines, 
                we may remove only the relevant content, take down the entire event listing, 
                or take alternative action that <em><strong>Tiqspace</strong></em> determines to be appropriate given the 
                circumstances surrounding the content. If the abuse of our Services is serious and 
                severe (in our sole evaluation), we may also suspend or terminate the associated 
                <em><strong>Tiqspace</strong></em> account. Note that certain content, while not in violation of our Community 
                Guidelines, may not be appropriate for the majority of our community. In these cases, 
                we may decide to make the content private or otherwise reduce its distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we believe there is a legitimate risk of physical harm to someone or a group of people,
                 or direct threats to public safety, we not only take action on our site, but will also
                 work with law enforcement, as appropriate and at our discretion. This includes issuing 
                 reports of child sexual abuse material to authorities such as the National Center 
                  Missing and Exploited Children. If you or someone you know is in immediate danger as a 
                  result of content posted on <em><strong>Tiqspace</strong></em>, please first contact 
                  your local law enforcement agency. Once you've reported the issue to law enforcement, 
                  click here to report the issue directly to <em><strong>Tiqspace</strong></em>.

                Our goal is to promote a safe and respectful community. 
                If you learn of any listing or content that may violate these Community Guidelines or our Terms
                 of Service, please contact us right away, or in the case of an event, use the Report This Event
                  link in the event's footer. We will review each report, and depending on the nature of the
                   report, we may or may not follow up with you.

                which includes material that depicts the sexual abuse and exploitation of children

                <p>
                    In line with  <em><strong>Tiqspace</strong></em>  Terms of Services, if you are organizing an event 
                    where children under the age of 18 (or the legal age of majority) may attend, 
                    the parent or legal guardian must register the minor and/or purchase the ticket on their behalf. 
                    You may not use our tools or Services to collect data directly from children under the age of 13.
